### Process
I tried to use Silex and Composer for this final application, but it did not work out too well since I am not too familiar working in the PHP environment.  
The main issue I ran into was setting it up on my local machine. I was able to run it using `composer run` after installing all the dependencies, but then I ran into the problem of where to make the files in which folders for organization sake and which folders had which purpose.   
I got confused on the Twig templating of how all that is set up. I was not able to set up or comprehend how to connect a SQL database into the app. I knew it had to do with one of the service providers or dependencies, but wasn't able to get it to work.

I then tried having a solo folder for an XAMPP application, but was not able to connect to the MySQL module on the solo folder. Therefore, the only thing that I could run to test my changes was working in the default xampp folder and have all my php files in the `htdocs` folder.
